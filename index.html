      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Currently I work as an apprentice electrician and I have loved computers ever since my first laptop at 14. I was able to work over the years to provide myself with the means to make a living and invest in a little education to start into the career field of my passion and here I am and I am super excited to learn and really happy to be here.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I have lived in Florida my entire life in a small town called Lake Helen and moved to Orlando just recently. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy playing music, kayaking, video games, and the gym.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be creating AI or machine learning that provides a new helpful use to people and society some examples being drones who can be dispatched and deliver first-aid items to rural or mountainous regions inaccessible to quick response vehicles or AI that can always keep  email spam at bay haha. I say my dream job would have to be AI developer It will take years and years of studying and immense effort and more code than HTML,CSS,and JS but I have to start somewhere I know if I can just get my foot in the door just maybe I can get the chance after years or a decade of learning to meet a group of people in creating something spectacular. That is my dream job.  </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently Florida</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>To create and start my career in the field of programming. I be exposed to others with such a wider skill set and knowldge than my own that I could learn from and I could afford more schooling and keep improving. I want to learn and I want do something useful for others. </p>
